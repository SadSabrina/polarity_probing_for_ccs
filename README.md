# `code/` — Source Code for PA-CCS Evaluation

This directory contains all the necessary scripts for reproducing the experiments described in our paper on **Polarity-Aware Probing for Quantifying Latent Alignment in Language Models** for analyzing internal representations in language models.

The code is organized to cleanly separate:

*  Feature extraction (`extract.py`, `extract_llama.py`)
*  Probing & analysis (`ccs.py`)
*  Evaluation & reporting (`format_results.py`)

## Files

### `ccs.py`

Base implementation of the **Contrast Consistent Search (CCS)** method for linear probing of model representations.

* Implements the linear probing training and evaluation procedure.
* Used to compute CCS directions and evaluate the empirical separation accuracy (ESA) and introduced metrics: polar consistency (PC), and contradiction index (CI).

### `extract.py`

Script for extracting hidden states from encoder, decoder and encoder-decoder based models.

### `extract_llama.py`

Script for extracting representations from LLaMA — just `extract.py` adapted for MetaLlama8b models.

### `format_results.py`

Post-processing utility that:

* Aggregates layerwise metric results (ESA, PC, CI).
* Computes group statistics (means, std, confidence intervals).
* Formats results for plotting or tabular reporting.

## Usage Notes

* All scripts assume that the input data is already formatted as sentence pairs with polarity labels.
* The dataset with pairs should be organized as follows. From $0, 1, 2 .... N$ sentences, the first $\frac{N}{2}$ harm (or safe) and the next $\frac{N}{2}$ safe (or harm). For 0, the pair index is $\frac{N}{2}$, for 1, the pair index is $\frac{N}{2} + 1$ and so on.
* The model interface is built on top of HuggingFace converters.

# **`notebooks/` — PA-CCS Evaluation Notebooks**

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for running and plotting **Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS)** on various language models. The notebooks are intended to reproduce key experiments and visualize model alignment behavior.

## Files

* **`ccs_deberta_pretr.ipynb`**
  Runs CCS and PA-CCS on **DeBERTa-large-FT** (`Elron/deberta-v3-large-hate`). Includes:

 * Extract hidden representations
 * PA-CCC training
 * Calculate and format ESA/PC/CI metrics
 * Visual diagnostics of metrics and separations

* **`ccs_Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.ipynb`**
  Applies PA-CCS to **Meta-LLaMA-3 8B Instruct** using reformulated harmful-safe statement pairs. Includes:

 * Extract hidden representations
 * PA-CCC training
 * Calculate and format ESA/PC/CI metrics
 * Visual diagnostics of metrics and separations

# **`data/` — datasets introduced in paper**


#### Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.9
* `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, `sentencepiece
`, `accelerate`, `tqdm`
* For LLaMA models: use HF-compatible checkpoints (with proper access)
